# Webots ROS2 Spot

This is a ROS 2 package to simulate the Boston Dynamics spot in [webots](https://cyberbotics.com/). Spot is able to walk around, to sit, standup and lie down. We also attached some sensors on spot, like a kinect and a 3D laser.
The world contains apriltags, a red line to test lane follower and objects for manipulation tasks.
